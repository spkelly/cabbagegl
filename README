SKGL
----

A really neat raytracing renderer that is more or less incomplete. When I get
done with adding more features, I plan to add a shader language (javascript). 
More or less, I want the thing to be as OpenGL-like as possible. Perhaps I'll 
expose a way to make the engine as parallel as users would like as well, but
I'll have to think about how.


Compiling
---------

I use ant as the build system.
Just do
    ant
to compile the source.
    ant jar
Will package it all up, and
    ant run
whould compile, package, and run the thing.


Notes
-----
Right now it just runs the main function in Test.java, which, throughout the
development phase of this thing will probably just contain hardcoded scenes
that I use to test the renderer.

Feel free to contact me if you want any info/help building your own/some neat
sources/anything at all.
